# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project


### Purpose


The purpose of this project was to analyze the entire dataset within short period of time including
expansion of the dataset of entire stock market. Using refractor, this analysis also aimed whether refactoring
code made the VBA script run faster or not.  
 


## Results

### Compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018

total of 12 different tickers and total of 3000 tickers were analyzed and total volume of each ticker were found in 2017 and 2018.
It was found out that yearly return for tickers were much higher in 2017 than 2018 where all tickers had plus yearly return except (TERP) whereas most of the tickers had minus yearly return except (ENPH and RUN) tickers. However, it was hard to analyze the change of total daily volume for each ticker where some tickers had higher total daily volume in 2017 whereas some tickers had higher total daily volume in 2018. In addition, some stocks that had higher return was found to have lower total daily volume. Lastly, the refactoring code for 2018 and 2017 was really quick where the code ran less than 0.09 seconds, 2017 took longer time to code than 2018.
 

 





## Summary

### Advantages vs disadvantages

Advantages for using refactoring code is that it takes short time to run the code, and the code runs without any mistake unless code is wrong. Also, it allows to analyze and compare the total daily volume and yearly return for each tickers. (Also, it allows to
compare between years as well)

Disadvantages for refactoring code is that it does not show individual volume, as well as the date, and the high, low and the close value of each ticker. 

### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script
When we compare the yearly return, refactoring code will be helpful to analyze since it quickly calculates the yearly return for
individual tickers. Also, when we compare the total daily volume for each ticker, it will be helpful as well. Also, when we need to conduct this analysis
within short time, refactoring code would be really helpful as it takes less than 1 second to code. 

However, if we want to investigate the volume of each ticker within range of days or weeks, refactoring code would not be helpful,
as it does not show individual data. This is best shown when we compare the relationship between yearly return and total daily volume, where some tickers have higher yearly return but less total daily volume, which requires to look over the individual data.
